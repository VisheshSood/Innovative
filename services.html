<h2>Nitrile</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-8">
<p class="pHeader">
Description And Use 
</p>
<p class="paragraph"> 
Nitrile gloves are made from a synthetic polymer that exhibits rubber-like characteristics when vulcanized. This polymer is made in the form of a latex or emulsion and can be processed in a similar way to natural rubber latex.
<br><br>
While latex gloves continue to dominate the disposable gloves market, increasing incidences of allergies from these gloves have given rise to a need for non-allergic variants, namely nitrile. A property of the latter that makes it unique and distinguishes it from latex is that other than its non-allergic properties, the nitrile polymer allows for additional properties such as resistance to puncture, anti-slip grip, and anti-static and anti-fatigue properties.
<br><br>
The other main difference between natural rubber and nitrile latex is that because natural rubber is a linear polymer it has to undergo a precuring process to enhance its strength before dipping. Nitrile polymers, on the other hand, are inherently cross-linked during manufacture so very little if any precuring is needed to enhance strength. No matter what the ultimate end use, nitrile polymers can be significantly tailored to achieve a variety of needs. When it comes to natural rubber one is essentially limited by nature's creation, with no room for change.

Features: 
</p>
<p class="paragraph"> 
- Zero natural rubber proteins
<br> - Powder-free/powdered
<br> - Greater puncture resistance than latex or vinyl gloves
<br> - Ambidextrous

<br> - Mildly textured surface and 2/3 finger textured for better grip

<br> - Reduced levels of chemical accelerators

<br> - Minimal odour

<br> - Beaded cuff for easier donning

<br> - Better dissipation of electrostatic charge

About Our Powder Free Gloves</p>
<p class="paragraph" style="font-style:italic !important;"> 
In order to ensure consistency and promise the highest quality of gloves, Innovative Gloves stresses a very high emphasis on the supply of raw materials. Our latex suppliers are ISO 9002 certified and have been supplying to U.S.A for more that 20 years. (in our previous plants) Highly qualified professionals have designed and analyzed our plant ensuring that there is no contamination of Iron or Copper in any process of the manufacturing process. We have also taken extra precautions by using stainless steel in 90% of our equipments and machines. Our machines are easily configured for double dipping manufacturing processes allowing us to fulfill our customers varying thickness specifications and requirements. Our professionals have designed 48 meters of pre and post leaching to ensure the extractable protein content is barely at non-detectable levels. Powder free latex gloves can either be polymer coated or chlorinated according to specifications.
